@ngdoc error
@name ng:areq
@fullName Bad Argument
@description

AngularJS often asserts that certain values will be present and truthy using a
helper function. If the assertion fails, this error is thrown. To fix this problem,
make sure that the value the assertion expects is defined and truthy.

If this happens when your are working with a new controller, double check if itÂ´s declared in your html file with the ng-controller tag in your element.
